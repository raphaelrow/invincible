A persuasive and a competitive person, who has her own perceptions about everything. A great thinker (but thinks way too much), who is dominating as well which is the quality of her inside leader.

He was quiet for a long time in his life, now he is balancing it with all his talking and comments on every other stuff… His dreams are to achieve great things in life and he is working hard to achieve it. A kind and warm person who stays calm and tries to make every complicated thing as easy as possible. He thinks he is very outspoken and very frank but actually it is a great deal to let him say what he wants. He cannot say “NO” to anyone, which he considers as his weakness and a way to learn new things. You can rely upon him for anything… He has so many people around him yet no one to have faith on. Different people for different things, that is what he believes in, move on from people and life.	            		</p>
	            		<p>
	            			His crazy PJ's suck yet he tries to crack some and yeah sometime it's hilarious, the timing is all what it takes. Crazy to do random stuff. His passion for travelling and adventures is appreciable. He wanted to be a pilot but now he is searching for what he is capable of doing. The love of his life is “football”. No matter how much he is hurt he will play it. He is a great photographer, but of nature.

	            		<p>
	            			He is introvert and it takes a great deal to let him open .. He’s kind of a guy who creates an illusion about himself and is totally different from that, he himself is kinda confused and doesn’t know exactly what he aspires in his life… Mummas’ boy n a lovely bro…who is very smart but acts as if he doesn’t know anything. Wonderful friend he can be, but makes very few for himself. His goal is to earn a lot and lot of money but he is still in search of the way to start with. When it comes to girls he is numb…but still likes simple marriage material types. Fakeness, bitching and fights are not his cup of tea. He is very unpredictable. His mood swings are something that even girls can’t match…but if he’s angry he forgets every stuff around him and afterwards he realizes it causes consequences.
	            		</p>
	            		<p>
	            			He is fun to be with but sometimes, irritating as well. His love for food is remarkable. His only baby is his ‘lappy’. a guy with nice heart but is lack of kindness which for him is kinda social service n fake , but still listens to other so that they don’t feel bad. He hates materialistic people. He can be influenced very easily. He can do anything for his friends (acc to him) and doesn’t give a shit about anyone else.

	            		<p>
	            			She be the eldest (in looks) sooo... cares for all. She has a free will towards her action and no force can stop her. She is gentle and wild and best of both the worlds. Though irritated and clumsy like most of the girls are, she can deal with every situation when required. What she desires is, spreading happiness and help people as much she can. During exams we all sit around her and she teaches us *course subjects* which makes her our teacher, our personal teacher :p and moreover makes sure that we at least pass. What she desires, is to experience everything, every adventure, relation and emotion.
	            		</p>
	            		<p>
	            			She is one of the best types of person. There is one annoying thing about her that is her high pitched voice and that’s why we call her "loudspeaker". She speaks so loud that everyone knows where our group is sitting. Over everything she can be blindly trusted and is very concerned about people who matter.

	            			The one whos'd kinda shy but he's a monster when he opens up.He's the one with all the inside jokes what we call "Dark Humour".The way and context in which he says some of his words is the best thing bout him.His mind keeps having random ideas which are mostly shitty but fun. This is the special TALENT that we know of.But there is another talent in his list which includes being silent and listening and observing phenomena.The theory executed in this process is hilarious AF when you listen to it afterwards.

	            			He's not fully sure about his future,dream job orlofe but he knows what he loves is a random adventure and exploring nature and long drives.Driving cars are the other things in list which make him a diehard fan of PW. One of his life goals include, eating the different types of ice creams around the globe.

	            		<p>
	            			 He is one of a kind... Their can’t be people like him. His jokes are most of the time lame but this makes him another source of entertainment. He is a very very helping person ... if he can do it, he will obviously do it. Though he has some preconceptions about everything, but understands when explained. He thinks about everyone, their likes, dislikes and never misses a chance to make them happy with the little cute things he does. Well sometimes his actions irritate but still everyone loves him alot. What he cherishes the most is friendship which he says he never experienced in his school days.
	            		</p>
	            		<p>
	            			 He is physically very active and creative. What he likes are video games, random anime movies and some characters in them. What he loves is adventure. Doing weird random stuff which normal people don’t think of, but is fun. His goal is to do something big through which he can actually help people in need. He wants to make his family proud and give them a happy, tension free life. Said na their cant be people like him. and we believe he will.
